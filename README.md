## Description and Requirements:
The application is a simulation of a toy robot moving on a square table top, of dimensions 5 units x 5 units.<br/>
There are no other obstructions on the table surface.<br/>
The robot is free to roam around the surface of the table, but must be prevented from falling to destruction.<br/>
Any movement that would result in the robot falling from the table must be prevented, however further valid movement commands must still be allowed. <br/>

Create a console application that can read in commands of the following form - <br/>
`PLACE X,Y,F`<br/>
`MOVE`<br/>
`LEFT`<br/>
`RIGHT` <br/>
`REPORT`<br/>

`PLACE` will put the toy robot on the table in position X,Y and facing NORTH, SOUTH, EAST or WEST. <br/>
The origin (0,0) can be considered to be the SOUTH WEST most corner. <br/>
It is required that the first command to the robot is a PLACE command, <br/>
after that, any sequence of commands may be issued, in any order, including another PLACE command. <br/>
The application should discard all commands in the sequence until a valid PLACE command has been executed. <br/>

`MOVE` will move the toy robot one unit forward in the direction it is currently facing.<br/>
`LEFT` and `RIGHT` will rotate the robot 90 degrees in the specified direction without changing the position of the robot. <br/>
`REPORT` will announce the X,Y and F of the robot. <br/>

This can be in any form, but standard output is sufficient. <br/>

A robot that is not on the table can choose to ignore the MOVE, LEFT, RIGHT and REPORT commands. 

Input can be from a file, or from standard input, as the developer chooses. 
Provide test data to exercise the application. 
It is **not required** to provide any graphical output showing the movement of the toy robot. 
The application should handle error states appropriately and be robust to user input.

## Constraints: 
The toy robot must not fall off the table during movement.<br/> 
This also includes the initial placement of the toy robot. <br/>
Any move that would cause the robot to fall must be ignored.<br/>

### Visualization
To visualize the robot movement and starting point please see reference below:

**PLACE at 0,0,NORTH**<br/>
As you could see we started at the bottom left corner of the table to mark the 0,0(x,y) coordinate<br/>

**MOVE**<br/>
When MOVE command is entered, we move the robot(bug) to 1 coordinate where the robot(bug) is facing<br/>

**LEFT/RIGHT**<br/>
When LEFT command is entered, we move turn the robot(bug) to the left/right.<br/>

**REPORT**<br/>
When REPORT command is entered, we get the position of the robot(bug)<br/>

### Limitations

The following features are yet to be implemented:

* Make the table size configurable
* Add 2 (or n) robots on the table
* Add more directions
* Add obstacles
* Support a different shaped table
* Macros
* Add a 3rd dimension

<a name="prerequisite"/>

## Prerequisite
* Create and tested using Visual Studio 2019(MICROSOFT VISUAL C++ 2015 - 2022 RUNTIME)
* Gtest(google test) was use for unit testing

## Instructions
### Unit Test
* Download or Clone the Repository git@github.com:omgcarlo/toy-robot-challenge.git
* Run toy_robot.sln via Visual Studio(preferable Visual Studio 2019 or up)
* By default, the (gtest) unit test will be the start up application. 
* Run it via "Local Windows Debugger"
### Application(exe)
* [Download Application Here](https://github.com/omgcarlo/toy-robot-challenge/releases/tag/basic_feature)
* Run Application
